# Edit Python in Neovim, Run in Jupyter: A Clean Jupytext Paired Workflow

Nov 8, 2025

In quantitative research and data science, we often use Jupyter notebooks for the interactive execution and visualization of code. However, jupyter notebooks have some limitations:

- they can be clunky to edit, especially for large codebases.
- Version control with notebooks is difficult due to their JSON format.
- IDEs often trade off efficiency for convenience.

But with Jupytext paired notebooks, we can bridge this gap — letting you edit .py files in Neovim and run the corresponding .ipynb notebook interactively, while keeping all previous outputs and execution counts

## setup
You need `jupyter`

```{bash} 
sudo pacman -Ss jupyter
```

And jupytext

```{bash} 
pandas_env
pip install jupytext
```

Go to a directory and run a notebook

```{bash} 
cd ~/lab1
jupyter notebook
```

Now you create a new notebook

File -> new -> notebook

Save the ipynb file

NOW you can follow the guide





## Concept: Two Representations of the Same Notebook

Jupytext allows a Jupyter notebook to exist in two synchronized formats:

notebook.ipynb ↔ notebook.py

They share the same content and structure, synced through metadata.

Whenever you edit one and run:

```{bash} 
jupytext --sync notebook.ipynb
```

the other side updates automatically.

- ✅ .ipynb keeps all outputs and execution states
- ✅ .py is pure text — perfect for Git version control
- ✅ Both stay perfectly in sync
    
## Creating the Pair

Let’s say you have an existing Jupyter notebook:

```{bash} 
jupytext --set-formats ipynb,py:percent demo.ipynb
```

This will:

- create a paired demo.py
- embed pairing metadata in demo.ipynb
- tell Jupytext that these two files represent the same notebook

## What Does py:percent Mean?

The py:percent format uses familiar cell markers to split code and markdown cells, like this:

 ```{markdown} 
# %% [markdown]
# # Notebook title
# Some explanation text

# %%
import numpy as np

# %%
x = np.arange(10)
x

	•	# %% marks a new code cell
	•	# %% [markdown] marks a markdown cell

```

This syntax is recognized by VS Code, Spyder, PyCharm, and Neovim. It’s simple, human-readable, and makes jumping between cells in Vim effortless.

## Typical Workflow: Neovim for Code, JupyterLab for Execution

Here’s how to combine them in practice.

Step 1 — Run JupyterLab

```{bash} 

jupyter lab
```

Open demo.ipynb and run the first five cells.

Step 2 — Edit in Neovim

```{bash} 
nvim demo.py
```

Edit the 6th cell and save the file.

Step 3 — Sync Changes

```{bash} 
jupytext –sync demo.ipynb
```

Jupytext will:

- detect .py is newer than .ipynb
- update the notebook source accordingly
- preserve outputs and execution counts for unchanged cells
- clear outputs for modified cells only

Back in JupyterLab, refresh the notebook — you’ll see updated code, with old results intact for untouched cells.

🎯 Result: you can write in Vim, run in Jupyter, and keep your notebook history.

Optional: Global Jupytext Config

To avoid repeating the pairing command every time, create a .jupytext.toml file in your project root:

## .jupytext.toml

```{bash} 
formats = "ipynb,py:percent"
sync_markers = true
```

Now, all notebooks will automatically use the same py:percent paired format.
